# OpenIntelligence RAG Pipeline Evaluations

This document describes the formal evaluations framework implemented in OpenIntelligence. This framework is designed to validate the RAG pipeline's behavior, latency, and quality against the target quality gates defined in [WWDC26.md](file:///Users/gunnarhostetler/Documents/GitHub/OpenIntelligence-Public/WWDC26.md).

---

## Quality Gates Target Metrics

The pipeline must satisfy the following metrics during an evaluation run:

| Metric | Target | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Retrieval Recall@5** | $\ge 0.85$ | Fraction of ground-truth chunks appearing in top-5 retrieval results. |
| **Citation Precision** | $\ge 0.90$ | Fraction of cited sources in generated responses that are correct. |
| **Exact-value Accuracy** | $\ge 0.95$ | Fraction of exact-value queries answered correctly. |
| **Unsupported-claim Rate** | $\le 0.05$ | Fraction of generated responses containing unsupported claims (hallucinations). |
| **Correct Abstention Rate** | $\ge 0.85$ | Fraction of out-of-scope/adversarial queries correctly abstained. |
| **Context Overflow Rate** | $\le 0.02$ | Fraction of queries that hit context window limitations. |
| **Visual OCR Evidence Use** | $\ge 0.90$ | Fraction of visual queries utilizing OCR text. |

## Dataset Format (`.jsonl`)

Evaluation datasets are represented as JSON Lines files, with one JSON object per test case. Comments starting with `//` and blank lines are ignored.

### Example JSONL Case

```json
{
  "id": "exact-001",
  "query": "What is the engine oil capacity?",
  "expectedAnswer": "5.1 qt",
  "category": "exact_value",
  "groundTruthChunkIds": ["chunk-abc-123"],
  "expectedCitations": ["Manual.pdf"],
  "shouldAbstain": false
}
```

---

## Execution & Report Generation

To run evaluations programmatically:

```swift
let dataset = try RAGEvalDataset.load(from: datasetURL)
let runner = RAGEvalRunner()
let results = try await runner.run(dataset: dataset, ragService: ragService)
let metrics = RAGEvalMetrics.compute(from: results)

// Generate Markdown Report
let markdownReport = RAGEvalReportWriter.generateMarkdown(
    metrics: metrics,
    results: results,
    datasetName: dataset.name
)

// Generate JSON Report for CI/CD tracking
let jsonReport = try RAGEvalReportWriter.generateJSON(metrics: metrics, results: results)
```

## Apple Evaluations Framework Integration

The `AppleEvaluationsBridge` class provides compatibility with Apple's command-line tools and testing suites (`fm CLI`), allowing the evaluation runs to be analyzed natively on Apple platforms.
