# Current State

Updated: 2026-08-20
Branch/worktree: main, clean, **not pushed** — `origin/main` is at `8791baa`, seventeen commits behind.
Last verified commit: c29e513

## Objective

**Get v5.0 shippable.** One question decides what 5.0 can contain and only the owner can answer it
(Blocker 1). Separately, **Deep Think underperforms Standard and the cause is now located**: fusion
degrades the ranking its own lexical arm earned, Standard's cross-encoder repairs it, and Deep Think
has no rerank stage to repair it with.

## Status

Six behavioural fixes shipped 2026-08-19, all on `main`, none pushed. Two benchmark runs completed
and are recorded in `BenchmarkRuns/LEDGER.md`. Nothing is running; no background tasks or monitors
are armed.

## Completed this session

| commit | change |
|---|---|
| `6992f36` | `LIBRARY STATE` section in the shared pipeline trace |
| `5307fdc` | fixed the crash `6992f36` introduced (`@EnvironmentObject` for a service never in that view tree) |
| `669f4c5` | intent misrouting, source-only evidence budget, review/extraction evidence mismatch |
| `ff24b72` | citation source-list mismatch, dangling-citation detection, grounding threshold, confidence formula |

**Two of my own diagnoses were wrong and tests caught both before they shipped.** I attributed the
intent misrouting to a `words.count <= 5` fallback; the query never reached it and the real cause was
a `lookupStarters` prefix rule several branches earlier. I then set the grounding threshold to
`< 0.5`, which would still have accepted the exact `2/4` case it was written for. Write the test
before believing the diagnosis.

## The finding that redirects everything

From `BenchmarkRuns/postfix-citations`, 8 cases x both modes, `pool_limit 10`, QASPER. **Deep Think
now emits six stages where `paired-retry` emitted only `final`**, so the pipeline is finally
measurable end to end:

```
standard      lexical 0.646 → fusion 0.448 → rerank 0.750 → final 0.812   (MRR)
deep-think    lexical 0.615 → fusion 0.431 → (no rerank)  → final 0.688
```

**Fusion loses roughly 30% of the MRR its lexical arm earned, in both modes independently.** Standard
recovers via the cross-encoder. Deep Think has no `rerank` stage and never recovers. That is the
Deep Think gap, attributed by measurement rather than argument.

Default fusion weights are `vector 0.7 / keyword 0.3`, weighting the weaker arm more than twice as
heavily as the stronger one. `RAGEngine.swift:982` already records lexical ranking the gold document
first in 60% of cases against dense's 8%.

**Accuracy moved but is not resolvable.** deep-think 2/8 → 3/8, standard 4/8 → 5/8, wall clock 94 →
58 min, timeouts 1 → 0. One case per mode is +12.5 points; the harness warns that below ~25 points
nothing resolves at this size. Directionally consistent, not proven.

## Do not re-investigate — settled

- **Query expansion degrades the lexical arm.** False. `searchWithFTS5` searches `originalQuery`
  (`HybridSearchService.swift:941,947`); expansions are a fallback only (`:967`).
- **The fusion weight can be decided in Standard mode.** False, and measured: `fusion-vw030` improved
  fusion on all four metrics at weight 0.3 (MRR +0.095, r@10 +0.143, nDCG@10 +0.109), `boosted` gave
  it back, and `rerank`/`final` were **identical to three decimals**. Standard's reranker normalises
  any fusion change out of existence. See the ledger entry.
- Retracted claims are listed at the end of `BenchmarkRuns/LEDGER.md`; read it before quoting any
  figure from anywhere.

## Active Constraints

- **Build from a copy outside iCloud.** `rsync -a --exclude 'BenchmarkRuns/' --exclude
  '.simulator-smoke.nosync/' --exclude 'Benchmarks/run/' ./ /private/tmp/oi-src/`, then build with
  `-derivedDataPath` under `/private/tmp`. In place it hangs in NSFileCoordinator.
- **Nothing else builds, tests or runs while a benchmark measures.**
- **Never `pkill` on the app path** — it matches the harness, whose command line contains `--app`.
  Match `Contents/MacOS/OpenIntelligence`. A timeout kills its own child correctly; confirmed four
  times, most recently 2026-08-20.
- **Core AI does not work in the simulator**, so anything touching embeddings is device-only.
- **The benchmark ingests into the real library** and protects pre-existing documents by snapshot.
- Commit to `main`; do not branch. Do not push unless asked.

## Working Set

| File | Why |
|---|---|
| `BenchmarkRuns/LEDGER.md` | Every run, what it settled, and five places analysis was wrong. Read before trusting any figure. |
| `scripts/compare_benchmark_runs.py` | Intersects two runs by `case_id` and prints a control line. Use this rather than hand-rolling a comparison. |
| `OpenIntelligence/Services/RAG/Orchestration/RAGEngine.swift:963` | `reciprocalRankFusion`, where the weights are applied. |
| `OpenIntelligence/Services/RAG/Retrieval/HybridSearchService.swift:208` | Where `vectorWeight: 0.7 / keywordWeight: 0.3` are defaulted. |
| `scripts/run_quality_matrix.py` | The harness. `--vector-weight` and `--resume` both work; resume skips completed cases. |
| `OpenIntelligence/Services/RAG/Tuning/AgenticPolicyService.swift` | Grounding threshold and confidence formula, both changed 2026-08-19. |

## Verification

Command → result, this session only:

- `xcodebuild test`, iOS 27.0 iPhone 17 Pro simulator → **256 tests, 2 skipped, 0 failures** (up from
  238). The skips are `EmbeddingProviderAgreementTests`, simulator-incapable, previously device-passed.
- `bash scripts/build_simulator_smoke.sh` → **BUILD SUCCEEDED**.
- macOS Debug build for the benchmark binary → **BUILD SUCCEEDED**, `/private/tmp/oi-mac-40`.
- `BenchmarkRuns/postfix-citations` → **16/16 complete, no timeout**, 58 min wall.
- `BenchmarkRuns/fusion-vw030` → 7 scored, 1 timeout, `results.json` written, no orphans left.
- `scripts/compare_benchmark_runs.py postfix-citations fusion-vw030` → control line reports
  `identical case for case, runs are comparable`.
- `BenchmarkRuns/fusion-vw030-deepthink` → **8/8 complete, no timeout**, ~35 min wall. Fusion MRR
  0.431 → 0.591, `final` MRR 0.688 → **0.530**, accuracy 3/8 → **2/8**.

**Not run:** the 25-case benchmark; anything on device since 2026-08-19.

## Blockers / Unknowns

1. **Which Xcode does Xcode Cloud use?** Only the owner can read it, in App Store Connect. PCC sits
   behind `#if compiler(>=6.4)`, eleven sites across six files; Xcode 27 measures as Swift 6.4. An
   Xcode 27 archive contains PCC (18 undefined symbol references to `PrivateCloudComputeLanguageModel`);
   any older Xcode omits it and every PCC request reaches `throw LLMError.modelUnavailable`.
   **Do not cite `.github/workflows/appstore.yml` — it has never executed and was deleted.**
2. **Settled:** the entitlement survives App Store distribution signing, verified by a local Xcode 27
   archive exported `method: app-store-connect`.
3. **A fresh import may still lose its vectors.** Three libraries found with documents and 0 chunks.
   `0350083` fixes the suspected cause and is unconfirmed. Needs three device imports; the protocol
   and the routing condition (`RAGService.swift:5569`, PDF-over-10MB) are on
   [the row](https://app.notion.com/3c149a74d54f81239443c15fe6ae3782).
4. **`boosted` degrades ranking in all four measured conditions**, and more the better its input.
   This is now the Exact Next Action rather than a blocker.
5. **Deep Think has no `rerank` stage.** Whether that is deliberate or an omission is unverified;
   `postfix-citations` simply shows the stage absent. Verify by reading where `RAGEngine.rerank` is
   called from `RAGService` and which quality modes reach it.
6. **A hang appears intermittently on QASPER paper `1604.02038`.** Third occurrence 2026-08-20:
   0.1% CPU for 21 minutes, then timeout. **It did not recur on the very next run of the same case**
   (`fusion-vw030-deepthink`, 234.5s, completed), so it is intermittent rather than deterministic for
   that paper. Cause unknown.
7. **Retrieval is ~21% reproducible.** Paired comparison plus the sign test is the only trustworthy
   readout. A single run cannot separate a change from noise.
8. **Two shipped engine changes have never executed on device.** `executeDirectSynthesis` still shows
   zero occurrences in every capture.
9. Known-but-unfixed, each pinned by a test asserting current behaviour so changing it is deliberate:
   a bare `what` prefix classifies as `.lookup`; `computePatterns` contains the substring `sum`, so
   `summary` and `summarize` classify as arithmetic and those two patterns are unreachable.
10. **Unfixed measurement defects** that distort any retrieval analysis, recorded on
    [the recall-gap row](https://app.notion.com/3bf49a74d54f81d593ddfe700f277f1e): `retrievalTime` is
    a hardcoded `0` on the agentic path; `timeToFirstToken` is `totalTime / stepCount`, confirmed by
    arithmetic against three captures; retrieval returns near-duplicate chunks; similarity scores
    collide on exact values (four chunks at exactly `0.7650`).

## Exact Next Action

**The working tree holds an unmeasured fix. Measure it before committing it, and do not commit it
blind.** `HybridSearchService.swift` is modified: a lexical survival guarantee — the reranker pool
is the top-K cut unioned with the lexical arm's best hits (`guaranteeingLexicalSurvivors`, both
hybrid paths). Suite-green (256 tests, 0 failures). The mechanism it addresses is established
per-case in `BenchmarkRuns/LEDGER.md` (2026-08-20 forensics entry): RRF fuses 3–9 lexical hits into
a corpus-length dense list, so lexical gold dies at the order-dependent 182→90 cut before the
cross-encoder ever sees it.

**Measurement is blocked by a Foundation Models outage on this Mac, diagnosed to its edge.**
Every process in this login session — the app, a pre-fix build of the app, and a bare Apple-signed
Swift script — fails inference with `ModelManagerError 1026`, while
`SystemLanguageModel.default.availability` reports `.available` the whole time. **The availability
flag is not a health check; only a real `session.respond` is.** A 15-second probe script pattern for
this lives in the 2026-08-20 ledger entry context: generate one word before trusting the stack.
Probable trigger: the Data volume hit 96% under accumulated build trees (16 GB since cleaned, 35 GB
free) and model assets were evicted. Everything reachable without root was tried and is exhausted:
simulator shutdown, user-domain agent kicks (`intelligenceplatformd` and `generativeexperiencesd`
are SIP-protected even in the user domain), `ModelCatalogAgent` kick plus delay. `sudo launchctl
kickstart` of the system daemon is refused under SIP. Remaining fixes are owner-only: toggle Apple
Intelligence off/on in System Settings, or reboot. `BenchmarkRuns/lexical-survival` is invalid —
every answer is the fallback text; do not read its numbers.

After the environment recovers (verify with a 1-case probe first):

```bash
caffeinate -dimsu python3 scripts/run_quality_matrix.py \
  --app /private/tmp/oi-mac-40/Build/Products/Debug/OpenIntelligence.app \
  --manifest Benchmarks/ResearchFixtures/qasper_external_v1/manifest.json \
  --pcc deny --pool-limit 10 --reset-shared-library --timeout 1800 \
  --sampling topk --seed 42 --temperature 0.7 \
  --modes standard --limit 8 --output-dir BenchmarkRuns/lexical-survival-2
```

Compare against `BenchmarkRuns/postfix-citations` with `scripts/compare_benchmark_runs.py`; check
the control line first. Predictions on record: controls identical; `candidates`/`rerank` r@10 ≥
baseline; `final` uncertain because the k=6 cut still applies. Final worse with controls intact →
`git checkout -- OpenIntelligence/Services/RAG/Retrieval/HybridSearchService.swift`, same as the
boost fix. Better or equal → commit code + CHANGELOG entry together.

**A reboot wipes `/private/tmp`, including the built binary.** The fix survives in the working
tree. After reboot: probe FM health first (one-word `session.respond` via `xcrun swift`, ~15s — do
NOT trust `SystemLanguageModel.availability`), then rebuild with the rsync+xcodebuild command in
Active Constraints, then run the measurement above. A clean re-measure of anything *else* requires
rebuilding from a stashed tree.
