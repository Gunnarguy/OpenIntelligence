# What's New

Public release highlights for OpenIntelligence.

## 3.1

This is the user-facing 3.1 summary focused on document understanding, OCR reliability, and grounded answer quality after the rushed 3.0 cut.

## Highlights

- Deep Think and Maximum now preserve strong grounded partial answers if a late-stage generation interruption happens, instead of replacing useful output with a generic stop footer.
- Multi-column PDFs, noisy scans, and corrupted tables ingest more reliably, with layout-aware OCR fallback and better row and column preservation.
- Tables now retain stronger schema, row, and cell anchors, which improves factual lookups for specs, measurements, and statistical values.
- Weak first-pass retrieval now triggers a corrective evidence pass before answer generation, improving dense scientific PDFs and technical manuals.
- Final answers are stricter about evidence quality, with unsupported or weakly supported claims handled more conservatively before they reach the UI.
- Maximum mode now reasons over evidence more cleanly, with better clustering and less tendency to polish weak support into overconfident prose.
- Source review is clearer on hard documents, with better structured excerpts and stronger abstention when the corpus does not actually support the answer.

## Earlier Milestones

- App Store launch on iPhone
- Local document Q&A with citations
- Native Apple platform integration for privacy-first workflows
